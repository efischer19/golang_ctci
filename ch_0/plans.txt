Plans for chapter 0

Before I get started with any actual questions, I want to make sure I understand go.

To that end, I'll be writing some trivially simple programs in this dir.

	-Hello World (already done with git setup thanks to https://golang.org/doc/code.html, in a separate location)
	-FizzBuzz
	-Fibonacci, to some reasonable amount of iterations

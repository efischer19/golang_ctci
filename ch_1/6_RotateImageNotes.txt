Consistent row/col references:
	I've been having issues conflating my rows/columns, so this will be the reference for how it goes.

Row comes first, then col.

Map of 3x3:
	00	01	02
	10	11	12
	20	21	22

So when swapping quadrants, I'll do it like this:
	-swap 00 with 01
	-swap 00 with 11
	-swap 00 with 10
	-to handle odd numbers, I'll designate one axis as "major", which will go one further to cover the midpoint
	-00 and 11 are col major, 01 and 10 are row major
	
	-so, given the above 3X3, I'll swap like this:
	-first: quad 00 with 01
		-source: 	{00 01}
			-col major, 1x2 grid
		-dest:	{02	12}
			-row major, 2x1 grid
		-result after swap:
			02	12	00
			10	11	01
			20	21	22
	-second: quad 00 with quad 11
		-source:	{02 12} col major
		-dest:	{22	21} col major
		-result:
			22	21	00
			10	11	01
			20	12	02
	-third: quad 00 with quad 10
		-source:	{22	21}
		-dest:		{20	10}
		-result:
			20	10	00
			21	11	01
			22	12	02

Boom, the input has been rotated 90 degrees in-place.
From here on, now more references to "x" or "y", that's confusing things. "row" and "col" instead.

Quad defs:
	-sum to binary 0 (00 and 11) - col major
		-else row major
	-if size of inpt grid %2 == 0, quads are square not rectangular
	-row/col 0: start at 0, go up to mid
		-else row/col 1: start at max, go down to mid
	-whichever of row or col is major is outer iteration loop
